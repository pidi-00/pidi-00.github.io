# t-SNE

t-SNE is a powerful method in order to visualize high dimensional data in a 2D or 3D dimension. I used this in a assignment in $\textbf{ELEC4630}$ in order to visualize the different clusters that 
my deep learning classifier performed on different animals.

I had a look at datacamp to enhance my understanding of t-SNE: t-SNE is an algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving the pairwise sim-
ilarities between instances. It accomplishes this through three steps. First, t-SNE calculates the
pairwise similarity between all data points in the higher-dimensional space using a Gaussian ker-
nel. This assigns higher probabilities to points that are closer together and lower probabilities to
points that are farther apart. Next, the algorithm maps the higher-dimensional data points onto
a lower-dimensional space while maintaining their pairwise similarities. It achieves this by minim-
izing the divergence between the probability distributions of the original high-dimensional space
and the lower-dimensional space. This optimization process is performed using gradient descent.
By optimizing the lower-dimensional embedding, t-SNE creates clusters and sub-clusters of similar
data points in the lower-dimensional space. Text gotten from [this site](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-t-sne).
