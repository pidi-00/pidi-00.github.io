Today I had my first lesson in the [fast ai course](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html). Jeremy mentions several things about deep learning I did not know about from before!

For starters, he states several myths that actually is not true about deep learning. This is shown in the table below. 

| Myth | Truth | 
|----------|----------|
| Lots of math   | High school math is sufficient   | 
| Lots of data  | WeÂ´ve seen record breaking results with < 50 items of data   |
| Lots of expensive computers  | You can get what you need for state-of-the-art work for free   |

The insights I have after the first lesson is that it is actually possible to get started with deep learning in a fun way by actually doing experiments without knowing
all the details about the underlying computations. For example today I finished a project where I scrape images of ten different animals of the web and then classify them. 
The classifyer had about a 98% avg accuracy based on about 180 images of each class. I am not really steady on the ground pilars/algorithms that fastai is build upon, but by
understanding the central functions such as DataBlocks and vision_learner I was able to complete this task without the in depth knowlegde. I think this is amazing, 
because its more motivational to actually get into the heavy academic material if you are able to experiment with real projects as well. This has been great so far, 
looking forward to dive even more deeper into the material in the time to come!
