# Introduction to deep learning

IÂ´ve recently started the fast ai course which you can find in this link [fast ai course](https://course.fast.ai) and will try to explain in my own words what I gotten so far from it.
First of all I must say I am pretty mind blown from how far deep learning have gotten the last few years. Jeremy Howard explains in it a fascinating way in the first lesson through a joke.
Quickly summarized the joke is basically that a scientist needs about five years of research to check if a photo is of a bird. In other words explaining that it is practically impossible. 
However, today Jeremy does excatly that in about the first two minutes of his first lesson. That is pretty remarkable.
