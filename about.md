# About me

![Image of myself](IMG_0575.jpg)

I am a masterstudent in electronics systems design and innovation by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with specialization in Signal processing and communication. I am currently undertaking my fourth year as an exchange student by the University of Queensland. I have set up this blog as a part of one of the courses I am currently enrolled in: 
$\textbf{ELEC4630 - Image Processing and Computer Vision}$. A part of this course involves fast ai, which is a course related to deep learning, and this blog will contain my learning journey as I am diving into this exciting topic!
